<h1>MES-replacement: T-diagram</h1>

The <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_diagram">T-diagram</A>
below gives all the steps that are taken to arrive at <tt>tcc-boot0</tt>
executable that is similar to the one in the <A HREF="https://github.com/fosslinux/live-bootstrap"
>fosslinux/live-bootstrap</A> project for this project, which does not rely on
the GNU Mes compiler. (The header files and the source for a standard library
that are part of the GNU Mes compiler, are used.)
<p>
This T-diageam is generated based on data that is generated with the
<A HREF="https://github.com/FransFaase/MES-replacement/blob/main/scan_trace.cpp"
><TT>scan_trace.cpp</TT></A>, which parses the <TT>trace.txt</TT> file that is produced by
running the <A HREF="https://github.com/FransFaase/MES-replacement/blob/main/task3.sh"
><TT>task3.sh</TT></A> Bash script.
<P>
Blue lines link input files with output files produced during the execution of
the <TT>check-tools.kaem</TT> script and verified to be equal with the <TT>equal</TT>
program.
<P>
You can use the mouse to pan and zoom within the diagram shown below. Clicking
on a process (a T-symbol) or a file name, will show additional information
including sources, if available. If this information contains links to other
processes and/or files, clicking on those link will show the element at the
center of the diagram with a yellow background.
